Make a fork of this project for you to push and pull to. Then open a pull request to dev branch, this will be the latest unstable branch. Then once that is stable, it will get moved to main which is our stable branch. We could make to where we just fork main, push stuff to our fork, and then pull request to main, but I leave that up to you guys. We can just push to main but most projects have you push to your own fork and the pull request to get it merged. Github's getting started docs are really helpful for getting started with git and github.
