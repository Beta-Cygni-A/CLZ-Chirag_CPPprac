## This is the Fuel Cost Calulator car program

Main idea:

This program is for calculating gas cost for shared vehicles.
It works by tracking how far the user went on a specfic day in a specfic vehicle.

include directory is for headers we make
third-party is for third-party code
src has the source code
archive has old code, used in testing and development
the various compile.txt docs are for you to use. FBcompile.txt I have setup to compile the current code
 on my FreeBSD computer using clang.
LX one is for Linux
WD one is for Windows

Status:
Currently I have a terminal program that creates a database, puts input in it, prints that input and asks user
for input in adding another vehicle to the database.
